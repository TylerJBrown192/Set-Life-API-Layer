# Set Life (API Layer)

This is the repository for the Rails 5 API Layer of the Set Life application, eventually located at [SetLife.live](#).

Set Life is an application for users who love all things music - concerts, bands, albums, reviews, everything.

Eventually this README will detail the technologies used for the back end of the application as well as the features it showcases.

You can find the Ember.js UI layer of Set Life [in this repository](https://github.com/TylerJBrown192/Set-Life-UI-Layer).
